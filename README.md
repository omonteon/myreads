# MyReads Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. 
In summary, this is a web application where you can search and categorize books.
There are three categories(shelves):

* Currently reading
* Want to read
* Read

> All books categories are synchronized on search results and in the home route.
